    <p>
      Spaghetti is a long, thin, cylindrical pasta made from durum wheat
      semolina and water. It's a staple in Italian cuisine and is known for its
      versatility in pairing with various sauces and toppings. The name
      "spaghetti" itself is derived from the Italian word "spago," meaning
      "string," reflecting the pasta's shape.
